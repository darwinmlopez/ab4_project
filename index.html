                        <h3>Overview</h3>
                        <p>Electric vehicles use one or more electric motors for propulsion and they are one of the main technologies to decarbonise road transport. 
                            They can either be powered by a collector system with electricity from extravehicle sources, 
                            or it can be powered autonomously by a battery. During the late 2000s, governments began their incentives to increase adoption of electric vehicles. 
                            We can see exponential growth in the sales of electric vehicles with improved range, more model availability and increased performance.</p>

                        <h3>Project significance and broader impacts</h3>
                        <p>In this project, we aim to understand the adoption trends of electric vehicles through demographic and geographic factors that influence growth in Washington State. 
                            Our goal is to acknowledge that electric vehicles are just one part of a broader transition to sustainable 
                            transportation systems and encourage policymakers to consider other solutions, 
                            such as public transit and active transportation.</p>

                        <h3>Primary functions and Major Data Source</h3>
                        <p>This project analyzes and visualizes the growth and distribution of electric vehicles and plug-in hybrid electric vehicles in Washington State. 
                            Our dataset is from Data.WA.gov, 
                             “Electric Vehicle Population Data” which shows the Battery Electric Vehicles (BEVs) and Plug-in Hybrid Electric Vehicles (PHEVs) 
                             that are currently registered through Washington State Department of Licensing (DOL). The data is created on April 16th in 2019, 
                             provided by the Washington State Department of Licensing (DOL) and owned by the Department of Licensing. The data will be cleaned and displayed as maps, graphs, charts, and comprehensive analysis. 
                             The aim of this project is to look into adoption trends of electric vehicles through demographic and geographic factors that influenced growth in the state.</p>
